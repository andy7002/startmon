Process/Thread Start Monitor

Monitor the creation of new processes on your system using the
Process Connector feature of the Linux Kernel, and subsystem
within NetLink.

This utility requires root privileges, or equivalent capabilities.
It is intended to be safe to setuid, as it exposes no information
that isn't already available in /proc.  However, it has not been
audited for setuid usage.

For each new process or thread, startmon issues one line of text
to STDOUT containing the event name, the parent process or thread,
if known, the new process or thread's ID, and a sanitized version
the process' command line.
